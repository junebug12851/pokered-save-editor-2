Aside from a small rant I'm skipping regarding PokeRed's extreme abstraction of 
audio to the point where it's nigh impossible to figure out any of the 
underlying information.

It's taken me more than 1 year and I still don't fully understand it but here is 
what I know now:

Music is given a bank and ID number, from the ID number an address is calculated
in the bank.

  * They're not consistently spaced apart and I still don't know how to get the ID 
  number

However we know the formula to convert the ID number to a proper address and we
know the actual bank and address of it so, well, we can throw out guess until we
get a match.

The formula to convert the ID number over is :
  * ID * 3 + 0x4000 = Address pointed to

And if we fully compile PokeRed we can get the symbol table which shows us the
correct destination addresses.

I appreciate the PokeRed team abstracting this away but it's done so much that
it's really impossible to figure out these IDs because of it and through much
error (Notably in the original Version) I've finally figured it out.

I tried enlisting in their help numerous times to figure this out but never got
any help so here are all the game music, the bank, and the correct ID number.

Thanks to the trial and error I did, I discovered you can have a slightly
incorrect id number which points to a slightly incorrect address, and produces
interesting music.

I also discovere that really short sound effects actually come off as just
"No Music"

If used as map music appears to be completely silent and imho more eerie than
Lavender Town
