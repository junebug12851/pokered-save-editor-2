# The "completed" one-shots — rods, Lapras, the starter, the guards, and one badly named bit {#world-completed}

The research behind [`../plans/map-screen.md`](../plans/map-screen.md) → **Phase 19**.

> **Fairy Fox, 2026-07-17:** *"Add in the fishing rod obtained old/good/super checkboxes again on the

Eight flags, and the answers are: **all eight are used, all eight are durable persistent save data
(none are scratch), every one is both written and read** — with **one exception that is written and
never read**, and **one whose name is a lie**.

⚠️ **`WorldCompleted` already models all eight, at the correct offsets.** The bits are right. **One
label is wrong**, and it is wrong in a way that would make a checkbox do something close to the
opposite of what it says (§4).

## 1. The one-line answer

| Flag (our name) | Byte · bit | Real name | Where it's SET | Where it's READ | Located? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `obtainedOldRod` | `0x29D4` b3 | `BIT_GOT_OLD_ROD` | Vermilion Old Rod House (163) | same map | ✅ **(2, 4)** |
| `obtainedGoodRod` | `0x29D4` b4 | `BIT_GOT_GOOD_ROD` | Fuchsia Good Rod House (164) | same map | ✅ **(5, 3)** |
| `obtainedSuperRod` | `0x29D4` b5 | `BIT_GOT_SUPER_ROD` | Route 12 Super Rod House (189) | same map | ✅ **(2, 4)** |
| `satisfiedSaffronGuards` | `0x29D4` b6 | `BIT_GAVE_SAFFRON_GUARDS_DRINK` | Route 5/6/7/8 Gates | all four | ✅ **4 maps** (§3) |
| `obtainedLapras` | `0x29DA` b0 | `BIT_GOT_LAPRAS` | Silph Co 7F (212) | same map | ✅ **(1, 5)** |
| `everHealedPokemon` | `0x29DA` b2 | `BIT_USED_POKECENTER` | the **Poké Center engine** | same routine | ⚠️ **every nurse** (§5) |
| `obtainedStarterPokemon` | `0x29DA` b3 | `BIT_GOT_STARTER` | Oak's Lab (40) | Oak's Lab **+ Red's House 1F (37)** | ✅ **2 maps** (§3) |
| `defeatedLorelei` 🐞 | `0x29E0` b1 | **`BIT_STARTED_ELITE_4`** | **Lorelei's Room, on MAP LOAD** | Indigo Plateau Lobby | ⚠️ **no x/y** (§4) |

**The bytes** (`wram = sav + 0xAD54`), each cross-checked against an already-verified neighbour:

- **`wStatusFlags1` = `$D728` → file `0x29D4`** — confirmed by `AreaPlayer` already reading
  `strengthOutsideBattle`/`surfingAllowed`/`usedCardKey` there.
- **`wStatusFlags4` = `$D72E` → file `0x29DA`** — confirmed by `AreaPlayer`
  (`noBattles`/`battleEndedOrBlackout`/`usingLinkCable`) and `AreaNPC` (`initScriptedMovement`).
- **`wElite4Flags` = `$D734` → file `0x29E0`** — the byte right after `wStatusFlags7` (`0x29DF`,
  verified), and `HallOfFame.asm` **asserts the adjacency itself**:
  `ASSERT wStatusFlags7 + 1 == wElite4Flags`.

## 2. The rods — three bits, three houses, one Fishing Guru each

Identical shape, all three (`VermilionOldRodHouse.asm`, `FuchsiaGoodRodHouse.asm`,
`Route12SuperRodHouse.asm`):

```asm
VermilionOldRodHouseFishingGuruText:
	text_asm
	ld a, [wStatusFlags1]
	bit BIT_GOT_OLD_ROD, a
	jr nz, .got_old_rod          ; already given -> the "how's it going" line
	...
	lb bc, OLD_ROD, 1
	call GiveItem
	jr nc, .bag_full
	ld hl, wStatusFlags1
	set BIT_GOT_OLD_ROD, [hl]    ; only AFTER the item actually lands in the bag
```

⚠️ **The flag means "the Guru has given you this rod", NOT "you have this rod."** The rod itself is an
ordinary bag item. Toss the Old Rod and the flag stays set — the Guru will never give you another.
**So clearing the flag is the repair**: it re-arms the Guru and you can be handed a replacement. That
is the editing effect worth putting in words on the checkbox.

⚠️ **`set` happens only on `GiveItem` success** — a full bag means no rod *and* no flag. The game is
careful here; a save editor that sets the flag without the item silently locks the rod away forever.
**Ticking the box does not put a rod in your bag**, and the UI must say so.

**Alike group: "Fishing rods"** — three different bits, the same kind of thing, one per place.
Exactly leadership's alike-group case.

## 3. Two flags that live on several maps — and they are SHARED, not ALIKE

**This is the distinction the group system rests on, so it is worth being exact:**

- **ALIKE** = *different bits*, same kind of thing (the 3 rods; the 11 towns; the 10 trades).
- **SHARED** = *one bit*, appearing on several map pages (Silph Co's flags across 12 floors).

Both of the following are **SHARED**, not alike:

**`BIT_GAVE_SAFFRON_GUARDS_DRINK`** — **one bit, five sites across four maps**: `Route5Gate.asm`
(**twice** — lines 21/46 and 73/90), `Route6Gate.asm`, `Route7Gate.asm`, `Route8Gate.asm`. Every gate
reads it, and every gate sets it, because handing *any* one guard a drink satisfies *all* of them.
The guard is an `object_event` (Route 5 Gate's is at **(1, 3)**), so each gate gets a real box on its
own map — **the same bit, five places**.

**`BIT_GOT_STARTER`** — **one bit, two maps**: set + read in `OaksLab.asm`, and read in
`RedsHouse1F.asm` (line 12 — Mum's "you should go see Prof. Oak" gate). One bit, two pages.

> ⭐ **Leadership called this in advance** — *"these may be called from multiple maps and liekly need
> grouping too group alike"*. The instinct was right; the group kind is **shared**. Which is a good
> sign for the two-kind model: the cases really do split that way in the data.

## 4. 🐞 `defeatedLorelei` IS NOT "defeated Lorelei" — and the mistake has teeth

**`wElite4Flags` bit 1 is `BIT_STARTED_ELITE_4`.** It is not about beating anybody.

**Where it is set** — `scripts/LoreleisRoom.asm`, and note *when*:

```asm
LoreleiShowOrHideExitBlock:
; Blocks or clears the exit to the next room.
	ld hl, wCurrentMapScriptFlags
	bit BIT_CUR_MAP_LOADED_1, [hl]     ; <- on MAP LOAD ...
	res BIT_CUR_MAP_LOADED_1, [hl]
	ret z
	ld hl, wElite4Flags
	set BIT_STARTED_ELITE_4, [hl]      ; ... just for WALKING IN
```

**It is set the moment you enter Lorelei's room.** You have not fought her. You have not beaten her.
You opened the door.

**Where it is read** — `scripts/IndigoPlateauLobby.asm`, and this is the part that matters:

```asm
	; Reset Elite Four events if the player started challenging them before
	ld hl, wElite4Flags
	bit BIT_STARTED_ELITE_4, [hl]
	res BIT_STARTED_ELITE_4, [hl]
	ret z
	ResetEventRange INDIGO_PLATEAU_EVENTS_START, EVENT_LANCES_ROOM_LOCK_DOOR
```

So its actual job is: **"did you start a run and come back to the lobby? then wipe the whole Elite 4
run and make them fight it again."**

> 🚨 **The consequence of the wrong label, stated plainly:** a checkbox reading *"Defeated Lorelei"*
> that a user ticks does **not** record a victory. It arms an **Elite-Four-progress reset** that fires
> the next time they walk into the Indigo Plateau lobby. **The label promises progress and the bit
> delivers erasure.** This is not a cosmetic naming nit.

**Inherited from v1 verbatim** — `WorldCompleted.ts` line 17: `this.defeatedLorelei =
saveFile.getBit(0x29E0, 1, 1);`. Same offset, same wrong name, carried into v2 without a second look.
**Same shape as the `fly.json` find**: right bits, wrong words, and nothing ever asked the game.

**The real "defeated Lorelei" already exists** and we already ship it: **`EVENT_BEAT_LORELEIS_ROOM_TRAINER_0`**,
one of the 2,560 event flags — and `LoreleiShowOrHideExitBlock` is right there checking it to decide
whether to unblock the exit. So this is not a missing feature; it is **one flag wearing another's
name**, while the real one sits on the Events section of the same panel.

⚠️ **It has NO x/y.** It is written by the map-load script, not by talking to anyone or standing
anywhere. It belongs to **Lorelei's Room (245)** and **Indigo Plateau Lobby (174)** as a page entry
with **no canvas box** — per the standing rule, *a spot whose location cannot be established gets no
box, never a guessed one*.

### 💀 And the bit actually named "beat the Elite 4" is dead

**`wElite4Flags` bit 0 = `BIT_UNUSED_BEAT_ELITE_4`.** `HallOfFame.asm` sets it — and pret's own
comment on that very line says `; unused`. **Nothing reads it, ever.** It is not modelled today, and
that is correct; if it is ever shown it must wear the grey **💀** and say so, because its name is the
single most misleading string in this byte.

**So `wElite4Flags` is two bits and both are traps:** bit 0 is named for a thing it doesn't do and is
never read; bit 1 does something real that its v1 name misdescribes.

## 5. `everHealedPokemon` — leadership's guess was essentially right, with one wrinkle

> *"for ever healed pokemon im guessing the nurse script activates it?"*

**Yes — but it is not a per-map script.** It is `DisplayPokemonCenterDialogue_` in
`engine/events/pokecenter.asm`: the **one nurse routine every Poké Center shares**.

```asm
DisplayPokemonCenterDialogue_::
	call SaveScreenTilesToBuffer1
	ld hl, PokemonCenterWelcomeText
	call PrintText
	ld hl, wStatusFlags4
	bit BIT_USED_POKECENTER, [hl]
	set BIT_UNKNOWN_4_1, [hl]
	set BIT_USED_POKECENTER, [hl]
	jr nz, .skipShallWeHealYourPokemon      ; <- the ONLY thing it does
	ld hl, ShallWeHealYourPokemonText
	call PrintText
.skipShallWeHealYourPokemon
```

⚠️ **All it controls is one line of dialogue.** If the bit is clear, the nurse adds *"Shall we heal
your Pokémon?"*; if set, she skips it. **It does not gate healing**, it does not gate anything else,
and nothing else in the game reads it. Clearing it makes the next nurse you meet greet you like a
first-timer. That is the whole feature, and the checkbox should be honest that it is a cosmetic
first-visit marker rather than progress.

⚠️ **It is set unconditionally, before the Yes/No** — walking in and declining still sets it.
"Ever *healed*" is therefore a slight overclaim: the real meaning is **"ever talked to a Poké Center
nurse."** Our name is inherited from v1 and is subtly wrong; the fix is words, not bits.

📝 **`BIT_UNKNOWN_4_1` (bit 1) is set on the same two lines** and pret has no name for it. Nothing in
the disassembly reads it. Noted, not modelled — a genuine unknown, and the honest thing is to say so
rather than invent a meaning.

**Location:** its writer is an engine routine, so its "where" is **every Poké Center's nurse** — a
real `object_event` on each of them. That is many maps, one bit → the **shared** group again, and the
biggest one. ⏳ **Not yet decided:** whether it earns a box on all ~10+ Poké Centers or belongs on
**General**. Leadership's call; both are defensible and the note refuses to guess.

## 6. Are they scratch? No — and here is why that needed asking

All eight live in `SECTION "Main Data"`, inside the saved block, alongside the event flags. **None is
scratch WRAM.** But "in the saved block" has never been sufficient on this project —
`wTownVisitedFlag` is in the saved block and the current town's bit is still re-set on every Continue
([`town-visited.md`](town-visited.md)), and `wStatusFlags3` is in the saved block and gets **zeroed
whole** on load.

⚠️ **And two of these bytes are known to be partly rewritten**: `AreaPlayer` already marks
`strengthOutsideBattle` (`0x29D4` b0) as *reset on load* and `battleEndedOrBlackout`/`usingLinkCable`
(`0x29DA` b5/b6) as *cleared on entry* — **the same two bytes these eight flags live in**. So a
loader that clears a whole byte would take the rods and Lapras with it.

🚩 **Therefore: PROBE BEFORE UI.** The prediction is that all eight survive (the rewrites above are
per-bit, not whole-byte — the `wMovementFlags` lesson from 2026-07-14, where reading the asm alone
got exactly this wrong). `scripts/emu/probe_world_completed.py` is **owed**, with the questions:

1. Do all eight survive a Continue?
2. Specifically: does anything clear `wStatusFlags1`/`wStatusFlags4` **whole**, taking the rods with
   the strength bit?
3. Does `BIT_STARTED_ELITE_4` really survive to reach the lobby's reset?

## 7. Traps, collected

1. **`defeatedLorelei` is `BIT_STARTED_ELITE_4`** (§4) — the label promises progress; the bit arms a
   progress **wipe**. v1's name, carried in verbatim.
2. **The bit actually named "beat elite 4" is dead** (§4) — written by Hall of Fame, never read.
3. **The real "defeated Lorelei"** is `EVENT_BEAT_LORELEIS_ROOM_TRAINER_0`, an event flag we already
   ship (§4).
4. **A rod flag ≠ owning the rod** (§2) — it means "the Guru already gave you one". Ticking it does
   **not** put a rod in the bag; it takes one away from you forever.
5. **`everHealedPokemon` means "ever talked to a nurse"** (§5) — set before the Yes/No, and it only
   controls one line of dialogue.
6. **Saffron guards + starter are SHARED, not alike** (§3) — one bit, several maps.
7. **`BIT_UNKNOWN_4_1`** is set by the Poké Center and read by nothing (§5).
8. **These flags share bytes with known rewritten-on-load bits** (§6) — which is exactly why the
   probe is not optional.
