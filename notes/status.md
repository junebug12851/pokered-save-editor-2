# Project Status

_Last updated: 2026-06-06 (post sed/mount corruption recovery; the pre-corruption work was session 13z11)_

> **RECOVERY NOTE (2026-06-06):** A bulk-`sed`/mount corruption truncated 55 source files + 8 notes;
> **all were fully recovered** from Cowork chat transcripts (method: `reference/diagnostic-methods.md`
> → "Recovering files from Cowork chat transcripts"). `pokemonbox.cpp`/`.h` were rebuilt by replaying
> the captured edit history onto the `af883fd` clone base and validated against transcript reads; the 7
> clone-based files (`settings.cpp`, `fontsdb.cpp`, `area.h`, `areasign.cpp`, `areasprites.cpp`,
> `pokemonstoragebox.h`, `storage.cpp`) had every residual fixed.
>
> **POST-RECOVERY BUILD-UP (2026-06-06):** The recovered tree did NOT build clean — the recovery left
> many residual defects that surfaced only on compile/link/run. Worked through them error-by-error;
> **the project now compiles, links, runs, AND Twilight confirmed runtime parity with the
> pre-corruption build.** Recovery is effectively complete. ⚠️ **COMMIT/BACK UP THIS STATE** — the only
> committed point (HEAD `2c2d6e5`) is the corrupted one, so until this is committed the working build
> exists only on disk. Key lesson (Twilight): **diagnose against git history,
> not HEAD** — HEAD (`2c2d6e5`) is the corrupted commit (many files truncated in it); the only clean
> reference is the 2020 tree (`af883fd`). Defect classes fixed (all in `reference/fix-patterns.md`):
> stray duplicate `util/hiddencoinsdb` in CMake; dropped `#include`s (mapdbentry, Qt6 metatype-complete
> property headers across savefile, pse-db/db.h); dropped private members (gamecornerdb/fontsdb
> `store`/`ind`/`buyPrice`, mapsearch tail); dropped friends (ItemDBEntry); dropped method bodies
> (DB::qmlProtect/qmlHook, FontSearch::clear/keepAnyOf, PlayerBasics::getPlayerId/getNonTradeMons/
> fixNonTradeMons); truncated/eaten declarations (area.h class line, filemanagement expandRecentFiles);
> old-API reversions (pokemonbox.cpp Random::/store/getIndAt); protected-field direct access
> (areasign/areasprites/mapselectmodel → getters); and a **runtime hang** — `FontsDB::splice` lost its
> `out.remove()` (reverted s13y replace-not-insert) → infinite loop expanding a variable tile.
> **Next: Twilight must COMMIT/BACK UP now (builds+runs; the prior backup was the corrupted one), then
> continue runtime testing.** Full account: `sessions/session-log.md`.

This file is the **current state** only. For the chronological history of what changed each
session and why, see `sessions/session-log.md`. For root-cause mechanics, see
`reference/qt6-patterns.md` and `decisions/`.

## Current State (read this first)

The big structural blocker is **solved**: the `brg.file.data.dataExpanded.*` chain works, data
reads and **persists** across every screen, and the build is fast. The other major class of
bugs — **QML garbage-collecting parentless C++ QObjects** (which caused the font/name blanking and
the clicking-Pokémon crash) — is also fixed (DB entries via `DB::qmlProtect`; savefile
`Q_INVOKABLE` returns via `qmlCppOwned`). Twilight confirmed: data flows, names render, no crash when
clicking around.

We are in a **UI-polish phase**. Two big screens are now polished + Twilight-iterated:

1. **Pokémon details editor** (General / DV-EV / Moves tabs + Glance pane) — sessions 13k–13t, Twilight
   signed off ("looking solid"). Conventions in `reference/ui-patterns.md`.
2. **Name editors — full keyboard + quick-edit popup** (`name-full/*`, `general/NameDisplay.qml`) —
   sessions 13v–13z8, heavily iterated with Twilight live. Now: wide centered name box; a **"Simulated"**
   group (label + Outdoor toggle + tileset combo + **Grid/Tileset** view toggle) using a flat-square
   `FlatToggle`; **single-select radio filters** (All / Normal Only / Single / Multi / Variable /
   Picture / Control) with help on a ⓘ dot; a **color-coded pill grid** whose hover tooltip renders the
   actual tile (image only, static, control = none); the **⋮ menus removed** in favor of explicit
   buttons (dice Randomize-Name, a **Name/Example** toggle + `>>` re-roll); the popup gained a Simulated
   bar across its top. The **example/box demo is now local to each editor** (never the regular name row).

The recurring underlying theme remains the **Qt 6 Material control-height issue** (Qt 6.5+ taller
`TextField`/`ComboBox`); the fix everywhere is proper layouts, not pixel offsets
(`reference/qt6-patterns.md`). **Read `reference/ui-patterns.md` before more UI work.**

**Last sessions (s13z10–13z11) — Trainer Card layout pass (QML-only, no rebuild):** (1) restored the
**centered grey box** (the `SwipeView` had been changed to `anchors.fill: parent` in the refactor →
back to centered `500×250`); (2) **compacted every field** via one `CardFront.fieldH` (28) knob +
tighter row margins, fixing the too-tall Qt 6 Material boxes; (3) **fixed the playtime clock** —
narrowed each digit field to ~2 chars (`PlaytimeEdit.digitPad`) and stopped the row sizing to the
Material implicit height (it now pins to `fieldH` and vcenters the `:`), which had made the digits ride
high; (4) **vcentered `DefTextEdit`'s built-in label** (it lacked `verticalAlignment`, so ID/Money/Coins
labels rode high). All Twilight-driven, live-iterated.

**Next:** continued Twilight review of the name editors; an end-to-end save/reopen verification pass. See
`plans/next-steps.md`.

**Documentation pass (started 2026-06-06):** A project-wide doc-comment effort is underway alongside the
Doxygen setup. The **common** layer is fully documented + verified (the style reference). Remaining layers
(savefile, db, app, qml) are queued and tracked in `reference/documentation-progress.md`; conventions in
`reference/doc-comment-style.md`. This is a deliberate multi-session effort (~374 files).

**Build/run notes:** C++ changed earlier in this arc (`FontSearch` 13v/13y, `PlayerBasics` +
`PokemonBox` 13w, `settings.h` colors + `fontsdb.cpp` splice 13y) and **two new QML files were added to
`app.qrc`** (`FlatToggle.qml`, `SimulatedTilesetCombo.qml`, 13z7) — all of those need a **Rebuild**.
Pure edits to existing QML hot-reload in debug. **New QML files MUST be added to `app/app.qrc`** or they
fail at runtime with "Type X is not a type" (this project resolves QML types via the qrc, not directory
scanning).

**Pending Rebuild (s14 — file-load crash fix):** C++ changed (`savefile.cpp`, `filemanagement.cpp/.h`,
`router.cpp`) **and** a new QML file was added (`screens/modal/FileError.qml`, already in `app.qrc`) — so a
full **Rebuild** is required. After building: test (1) clicking a recent file whose path no longer exists →
should silently be gone from the list on next launch, never crash; (2) opening a present-but-truncated/locked
`.sav` → should show the `FileError` modal, and the underlying save stays untouched.

## Open Issues

| Issue | Where | Status / notes |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| ~~`PokemonBox::update(resetType=false, …)` clobbered a dual-type mon's `type2`~~ (+ 2 related type/reset bugs) | `pokemonbox.cpp` `update()`, `isCorrected()`, `isPokemonReset()` | **Fixed 2026-06-08 (Twilight-approved, brought to her before fixing).** Found while coverage-testing `pokemonbox.cpp` (`tst_pokemonbox`). (1) `update()`'s bare `else type2 = toType1->ind` ran on every call with `resetType=false`, overwriting a dual-type mon's `type2` with `type1` (silently dropping the second type; reachable via `maxLevel`/`maxEVs`/`resetEVs`/`reRollEVs`/`manualLevelChanged`; emitted no `type2Changed`). Fixed: type2 (re)derivation is wrapped in `if(resetType)`. (2) `isCorrected()` vs `update()` disagreed for a species whose DB `toType2`==`toType1` (update collapses to `type2=0xFF`; isCorrected demanded `type2==toType2->ind`). Fixed: isCorrected treats a record as dual-type only when `toType2` genuinely differs from `toType1`, accepting `0xFF` or `type1` for single types (faithful to the DB's mixed 0xFF-vs-duplicate storage). (3) the empty-slot bug in `isMaxPP()`/`isMaxPpUps()` (an empty moveID-0 slot counted as "not maxed") propagated into `isHealed()`, so **any mon with <4 moves could never read as healed** (user-facing — the heal indicator — not just `isPokemonReset()`). Twilight asked this not be squashed aside; fixed at source: `isMaxPP`/`isMaxPpUps` skip empty slots (mirroring `isMaxedOut`'s guard), `isPokemonReset` then simplifies to iterate the real initial moves, check `ppUp==0`, reuse `isHealed()`. Regression-guarded in `tst_pokemonbox` (incl. `box_healedWithFewerThanFourMoves`). type2 single-WRITE truth + `isMinEvs` `||` tracked in `plans/next-steps.md`. See `reference/fix-patterns.md`. |
| ~~Area-family bugs (3, found coverage-testing area/\*)~~ | `areatileset.cpp`, `pokemonbox.cpp`, `areapokemon.cpp` | **Fixed 2026-06-08 (Twilight-approved, brought before fixing).** (1) `AreaTileset::loadFromData` inverted ternary — `(map==nullptr) ? map->getToTileset() : nullptr` crashed on a null map and discarded the real tileset on a non-null map (both branches wrong); fixed to `? nullptr : map->getToTileset()`. Masked today (disabled Maps path). (2) `PokemonBox::newPokemon(Random_Pokedex)` rolled `rangeExclusive(1,151)` so could **never randomize to Bulbasaur** — dex keys are 0-based (probe-confirmed: dex0=Bulbasaur..dex150=Mew, dex151 null); fixed to `rangeExclusive(0,151)`. (3) `AreaPokemon::setTo` array writes lacked an `i < wildMonsCount` bound (gen-1 tables are always 10, so defensive); guarded. All regression-guarded in `tst_area_logic` (+ `tst_pokemonbox`). See `reference/fix-patterns.md`. |
| ~~`isMinEvs()` used `\|\|` (true if ANY one stat-exp is 0)~~ | `pokemonbox.cpp` `isMinEvs()` | **Fixed 2026-06-08 (Twilight-confirmed).** Changed to `&&` (all five stat-exp must be 0), matching the header's "All stat-exp zero?" and symmetric with `isMaxEVs()`. The `\|\|` had a real UX impact: `StatsTab.qml` disables the **"Reset EVs"** menu on `isMinEvs`, so the action was greyed out whenever a single stat-exp happened to be 0, even on a heavily-EV'd mon. Regression-guarded in `tst_pokemonbox` (`box_reRollEvsAndMaxPpUps`). |
| **Latent (not a live bug): map DB `getToMap()`/`getToSprite()` are never resolved** — `MapsDB::deepLink()` is **not** called anywhere in the program (`DB::deepLinkAll()` omits it; nothing else calls it). So every map's warp/connect/sprite `getToMap()`/`getToSprite()` pointer stays null. | `db/.../db.cpp` `deepLinkAll()`; consumers `WarpData::load(warp)`, `MapConnData::loadFromData`, `SpriteData::load`, `AreaMap::loadFromData`/`setTo` | **Not a crash today** because every consumer is part of the **not-yet-wired Maps feature** (Maps screen greyed out; map randomize disabled — see the randomizer row). Normal save load/expand reads Area straight from save bytes, never from a `MapDBEntry`, so the null pointers are never dereferenced. **Landmine for when Maps is enabled:** wiring `AreaMap::setTo`/map-change or re-enabling map randomize will dereference these → instant crash unless `MapsDB::inst()->deepLink()` is called first (add to `DB::deepLinkAll()` or before the first map edit). Found 2026-06-08 while coverage-testing `WarpData`/`MapConnData` (the `tst_map_fragments` test calls `MapsDB::inst()->deepLink()` itself to exercise these paths; it's stable headless). Aligns with the existing "re-enable map randomize" checklist in the randomizer row. **Confirmed 2026-06-08 (`tst_sprite_data`):** with `deepLink()` called, **all 918 map sprites resolve `getToSprite()` (0 nulls)** and `SpriteData::setToAll`/`randomizeAll` run clean over all 249 maps — so the documented sprite-link "crash" is purely this deepLink-not-called landmine, **not** a SpriteData defect (spritedata.cpp is now 100% tested). The standing fix remains: call `MapsDB::inst()->deepLink()` (e.g. in `DB::deepLinkAll()`) before any map feature dereferences these. |
| Randomizer: not-yet-built screens (Maps, Hall of Fame, Options) excluded from randomization | `savefileexpanded.cpp`, `worldgeneral.cpp` | **Working as of 2026-06-07 (Twilight-authorised).** `randomizeExpansion()` now runs end-to-end and is test-covered (`tst_randomizer` 10-iteration invariants + `tst_verbs` byte-fidelity, both green). Commented out (matching the disabled home tiles — those features aren't wired yet): **Maps** = `area->randomize()` (`SaveFileExpanded::randomize`) + the two map picks in `WorldGeneral::randomize` (`isCity()`/`isType("Outdoor")`); **Hall of Fame** = `hof->randomize()`; **Options** = the `options`/`letterDelay` block in `WorldGeneral::randomize`. (Event Pokémon has no save-randomize path.) Each is clearly commented with a re-enable note. Bugs found+fixed along the way: `MapSearch::isType()` null-deref (deref of null `toTileset`); `HoFPokemon::load()` null-deref (dereferenced `saveFile` before its null check — also crashed `HoFRecord::pokemonNew`/`new HoFPokemon`). **To re-enable map randomize (future map feature):** fix the tileset type strings (`isType("Cave")`/`isType("Outdoor")` currently match **0 maps**), guard/repair `SpriteData::load()` on unresolved `getToSprite()` links, and guard the `pickRandom()->getInd()` null cases in `area/*` + `worldgeneral`. Minor: `HoFPokemon::randomize()` looks up `getIndAt("dex"+N)` (not a real key) → HoF mons randomize to species 0 (cosmetic; not a crash). |
| ~~Save corruption: `recalcChecksums()` wrote the bank-2 box checksum off-by-one~~ | `savefiletoolset.cpp` `recalcChecksums()` | **Fixed + test-verified 2026-06-07.** Was `data[0x5A4B] = getChecksum(0x4000, 0x1A4B)`; corrected to **`data[0x5A4C] = getChecksum(0x4000, 0x1A4C)`** (matches `recalcBoxesChecksums()`, the `.bt` oracle, and real RBY `sBank2AllBoxesChecksum`). The old code clobbered **Box 6's last data byte** (`0x5A4B`, `00`→`C5`) on every save of a *progressed* file and stored the checksum one byte early. `tst_roundtrip` now round-trips `BaseSAV.sav` byte-perfect (`flatten` was already 0-diff; this was the only divergence). The `if(data[0x284C]==0) return` guard (skip box checksums when the game never formatted the boxes) is **intentional and faithful to the game** — confirmed by Twilight. See `reference/fix-patterns.md`. |
| ~~Crash (access violation) in `Daycare::~Daycare()` on an empty Day Care~~ | `daycare.cpp` | **Fixed 2026-06-07.** Destructor did `pokemon->deleteLater()` unconditionally; `pokemon` is null when the Day Care is empty → null-`this` deref. Now guarded `if(pokemon != nullptr)` (matching `reset()`). Masked in the app (SaveFile only destroyed at exit). **Found by `tst_roundtrip`.** See `reference/fix-patterns.md`. |
| ~~Crash on load: opening a missing/unreadable recent file crashed in `setData` (`memcpy` from null)~~ | `savefile.cpp`, `filemanagement.*`, `App.qml`, `FileError.qml`, `router.cpp` | **Fixed (s14, needs Rebuild — C++ + new QML in qrc).** `setData` guards null; `readSaveData` rejects files smaller than 32 KB (at-least, not exact — larger files load their first 32 KB) and captures the real OS/Qt error detail; loads route through `loadData()` (never mutates the save on failure). Startup `pruneRecentFiles()` silently drops unopenable recents (**"prune" not "scrub"** — scrub == `wipeUnusedSpace`). Present-but-unreadable/truncated files raise the new **`FileError`** full-window modal: plain-English reason centred, real technical detail small/muted below (**no fake codes**); closing returns to the prior screen. Twilight-specified UX. ⚠️ Not yet build-verified on her machine. |
| ~~Pokémon editor: values not reacting / DV-EV / moves / shiny menus dead~~ | `pokemon-details/*` | **Fixed + Twilight-confirmed (s13l).** `function onX()` dead handlers → `onX:`. |
| ~~Pokémon editor: boxes too tall / overlapping / misalignment~~ | `pokemon-details/*` | **Fixed + Twilight-confirmed (s13m–s13t).** |
| ~~Full keyboard rebuild (name box / Simulated group / filters / pill grid / view toggle)~~ | `name-full/*`, `FullKeyboard.qml` | **Done + Twilight-iterated (s13v–s13z8).** |
| ~~Quick-edit popup broken out of its ⋮ menu (buttons + Simulated bar)~~ | `general/NameDisplay.qml`, `NameEdit.qml` | **Done (s13z7–z8).** |
| ~~Player/rival name (+ ID) edit hang / per-keystroke save writes / OT corruption~~ | `PlayerBasics`, `PlayerNameEdit`/`Rival`/`PlayerIdEdit` | **Fixed s13w.** Writeup: `reference/player-name-hang.md`. UX confirmed-ish: player **ID** applies on Enter/blur. |
| ~~`expandStr` infinite-loop freeze on a lone variable tile~~ | `db/.../fontsdb.cpp` `splice` | **Fixed s13y** (replace-not-insert). |
| ~~Tileset picker last tile (bold "9") not clickable~~ | `name-full/TilesetPicker.qml` | **Fixed s13y2** (off-by-one; `fontAt` is 1-based). |
| Name editors — Twilight's continued review | `name-full/*`, `general/NameDisplay.qml` | Open: ongoing live tweaks. `NameEdit`/`NameDisplay` shared by player/rival/nickname + keyboard footer — verify all on each rebuild. |
| Full keyboard: right-side `DetailView` (text info on hover) | `name-full/DetailView.qml` | Still present + wired alongside the pill tooltip. Confirm it still reads well / whether Twilight wants to keep it. |
| ~~Trainer-card box size / field spacing / clock width / label centering~~ | `TrainerCard.qml`, `CardFront.qml`, `PlaytimeEdit.qml`, `DefTextEdit.qml` | **Done + Twilight-confirmed (s13z10–z11).** Centered box restored (`500×250`); `CardFront.fieldH` (28) compacts every field; playtime narrowed (`digitPad`) + row pinned to `fieldH` so digits/`:` vcenter; `DefTextEdit` label now vcenters. Tuning knobs in `ui-patterns.md`. (Horizontal text padding inside the non-clock fields still at `DefTextEdit` default — trim per-instance only if Twilight wants it tighter.) |
| Dead menu files (unused after s13z7) | `name/NameDisplayMenu.qml`, `NameDisplayMenuNoTileset.qml`, `TilesetMenu.qml` | No longer instantiated; left in place + in qrc. Safe to delete later. |
| Home tiles for not-yet-available screens greyed out + non-clickable | `HomeIconsModel.qml`, `IconDelegate.qml` | **Done (QML-only, hot-reloads).** New `disabled` model role; delegate uses `enabled: !model.disabled` + a `MultiEffect` layer (slight desaturate/darken). Disabled: **Maps, Options, Hall of Fame, Event Pokemon.** Convention + tuning dials in `reference/ui-patterns.md` → "Disabled / coming soon Home tiles". |

Intentional (not bugs): Pokémon names show **on hover** only (Twilight confirmed). The player **ID**
commits on Enter/focus-out (not per keystroke) — Twilight can revert if she wants it live.

`NameDisplay` / `NameEdit` are **shared** by the player-name, rival, and nickname editors (and
`NameDisplay` is the keyboard footer preview). Changes touch all of them; verify each on a rebuild.

## Testing (added 2026-06-07)

A comprehensive automated test suite now exists under `projects/tests/` (QtTest + CTest, **51
executables, all green** — last full run re-verified 2026-06-08 on the real Qt 6.11
llvm-mingw kit: clean rebuild, `ctest` 51/51 including `tst_pokemonbox` + `tst_sprite_data` +
`tst_area_logic`). A **coverage-gap-fill pass toward the 100% target is underway** — savefile real-source
line coverage is now **89.4%** (this pass: `pokemonbox.cpp` 72%→94.6%, `spritedata.cpp` 46%→100%,
`areatileset.cpp` 62%→100%, `areamap.cpp` 62%→93%, `areapokemon.cpp` 61%→90%); see `plans/testing.md` for
the live savefile gap list and per-file progress. The app logic was extracted into a static `appcore` library
(see `context/architecture.md`) so the **app layer is now unit-testable** (`tests/mvc/tst_models.cpp`
is the first; ~23 models + Bridge/Router remain). It found + drove fixes for **4 real bugs** (Daycare empty-dtor
crash, bank-2 checksum off-by-one save corruption, `MapSearch::isType` null-deref, `HoFPokemon::load`
null-deref). Covers the savefile engine (fields/verbs/Pokémon/items/world/toolset/errors/E2E),
common, db integrity, and the randomizer (within its current scope). Build/run any time with the real
kit: `cmake --build <build> && ctest --output-on-failure` (add `SetErrorMode(0x0003)` first so a
crashing test fails fast instead of popping `qtcdebugger`). Full strategy, measured coverage baseline,
and remaining gaps: **`plans/testing.md`**.

## Build Health

| Layer | Status |
|-------|--------|
| common | ✅ Clean |
| db | ✅ Clean |
| savefile | ✅ Clean (header includes reworked s13/s13c; `Q_DECLARE_OPAQUE_POINTER` only on untraversed types; `qmlownership.h` added) |
| app | ✅ Clean |

Build speed restored s13c (over-includes trimmed). `dllimport` warning silenced via
`-Wno-ignored-attributes` in root `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Runtime Health

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|

| `dataExpanded.*` chain — all screens read + persist data | ✅ (s13/s13b) |
| Trainer Card / Bag / Pokémon storage data | ✅ Twilight confirmed |
| Trainer + Rival name render (animated) + persist | ✅ (s13f — was QML GC of FontDBEntry) |
| Pokémon box: click → details opens; no crash | ✅ (s13d click, s13g/h GC crash fix) |
| Pokémon box: hover name (+ pen icon) shows | ✅ (s13j — explicit `contentItem`); pen now tints light (s13k `brightness:1.0`) |
| Combo box (Select*) popups scroll on long lists | ✅ (s13k — capped popup `height`) |
| Badges; Pokédex toggles | ✅ |
| Number fields (playtime / item count / PP) width + centering | ✅ (s13b/s13e) |
| Trainer-card Coins/Starter/Money overlap | ✅ (s13e `.bottom` anchoring) |
| Trainer-card layout — centered box, compact fields, clock width, label centering | ✅ Twilight-confirmed (s13z10–z11): `SwipeView` 500×250; `CardFront.fieldH`; `PlaytimeEdit` `digitPad` + row pinned to `fieldH`; `DefTextEdit` label vcentered |
| Randomize name (full editor + trainer screen) | ✅ (s13e) |
| Keyboard filter / description / random / button styling | ✅ (s10–11) |
| Pokémon **editor** responsiveness (species/level/status/HP, moves, DV/EV, shiny, menus) | ✅ Fixed + Twilight-confirmed (s13l) |
| Pokémon **editor** layout + styling (GridLayout/RowLayout, heights, borderless combos w/ hover, square move pills, ⋮ buttons, slider hover tooltips) | ✅ Polished + Twilight-confirmed (s13m–s13t) |
| Pokémon **nickname / player-name / rival** edit popup (centered overlay, dismissible, live preview, keyboard button) | ✅ (s13r–s13t); broken out of its ⋮ menu into buttons + Simulated bar (s13z7–z8) |
| **Full keyboard** — name box, Simulated group (Outdoor/Tileset/Grid-Tileset), radio filters, pill grid + tile tooltip, Name/Example toggle | ✅ Reworked + Twilight-iterated (s13v–s13z8) |
| Player/rival name + player ID — atomic commit-on-finish, no hang, no OT corruption | ✅ (s13w) |
| Tileset picker — every tile (incl. last) clickable; no freeze on variable render | ✅ (s13y / s13y2) |

## Recurring Non-Fatal Warnings (harmless)

- `'dllimport' attribute ignored` on `MapDBEntry` etc. — Qt + llvm-mingw shared-lib cosmetic;
  **silenced** via `-Wno-ignored-attributes` (s13c).
- Items "could not be deep linked" / "Values are not correct on sprite X" — pre-existing data.
- On exit: `QDxgiVSyncService not destroyed in time`, `QThreadStorage entry N destroyed…` — benign
  Qt shutdown ordering.

## The "crashes" — two different things

1. **System-wide** Qt-debugger pop-ups (also in Notepad/taskbar/Settings) — environment/Qt-install
   issue, NOT this app. Don't chase.
2. **In-app** use-after-free from QML GC'ing parentless C++ QObjects — **fixed** (s13f/g/h). A
   silent "terminated abnormally" after interaction was this. If a real in-app crash recurs, get a
   project-debugger stack trace. Details: `reference/diagnostic-methods.md`, `sessions/session-log.md`.
